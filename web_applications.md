## Web Application Layout

| Category | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Web Application Infrastructure | Describes the structure of required components, such as the database, needed for the web application to function as intended. Since the web application can be set up to run on a separate server, it is essential to know which database server it needs to access. | 
| Web Application Components | The components that make up a web application represent all the components that the web application interacts with. These are divided into the following three areas: UI/UX, Client, and Server components. | 
| Web Application Architecture | Architecture comprises all the relationships between the various web application components. |
